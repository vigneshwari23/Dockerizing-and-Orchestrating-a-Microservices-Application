**INTRODUCTION** 
Modern IT infrastructure relies largely on virtualization, containerization, and software-defined 
technologies to improve efficiency, scalability, and resource management. This documentation delves 
into essential topics such as software-defined elements (SDN, SDS, SDDC), hypervisors, virtualization, 
and containerization, focusing on Docker as the dominant containerization platform.  
The guide walks you through Docker installation, configuration, and basic CLI commands. It also 
examines how containerization affects DevOps approaches like automation, microservices 
architecture, and CI/CD pipelines. In addition, we investigate Docker Engine, container orchestration 
using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, and automated deployments with Helm and ArgoCD. 
By the end of this article, readers will have a thorough understanding of containerization 
technologies and their importance in modern software development and deployment.
